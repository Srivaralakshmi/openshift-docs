= Understanding Argo CD permission model for multitenancy support

With {gitops-shortname} Operator on Red Hat {OCP}, as a cluster administrator, you can provide multitenant access to the cluster for application delivery teams (tenants). You can allow tenants to create and manage dedicated Argo CD instances in their user-defined namespaces without having administrative permissions. The tenants have full autonomy and can tailor this instance to their needs and requirements without interfering with other tenants. For a multitenant cluster, the person managing the Argo CD varies from the person who manages the cluster and its users. Therefore, you cannot have the `argocd-application-controller` component as a super-user in the cluster. Because this component is responsible for the reconciliation of resources in the managed cluster(s), for the multitenancy support with {gitops-shortname} Operator, depending on your use cases, tenants, and requirements, you must configure, grant, extend, or restrict specific permissions explicitly to Argo CD instances, applications, and on remote clusters to perform certain operations.

Granting multitenant cluster administration privileges might allow tenants to bypass any multitenancy efforts and permission restrictions because they might elevate their privileges using permissions granted to the application by Argo CD. To prevent such situations, you must understand the permission model for Argo CD installed through the {gitops-title} Operator and how to leverage it to be successful with OpenShift {gitops-shortname} for application delivery.
