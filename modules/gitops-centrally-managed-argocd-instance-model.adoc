= Centrally managed Argo CD instance model

The centrally managed Argo CD instance model does not isolate the tenants from each other. This model supports a centrally managed Argo CD instance shared among multiple tenants. However, you require a central entity responsible for setting up and maintaining governance over that central Argo CD instance, and as such, this model involves additional administrative effort.

This model assumes that all tenants trust each other to a certain extent, and the principal purpose is to ensure that a tenant is only able to access a specific part of the cluster(s) managed by that Argo CD instance. You can restrict tenants to be able to manage only a distinct set of resources in a specific set of namespaces on certain clusters.
