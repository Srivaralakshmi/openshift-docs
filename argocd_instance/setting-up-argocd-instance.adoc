= Setting up an Argo CD instance
:context: setting-up-argocd-instance

toc::[]

By default, the {gitops-title} installs an instance of Argo CD in the `openshift-gitops` namespace with additional permissions for managing certain cluster-scoped resources. To manage cluster configurations or deploy applications, you can install and deploy a new Argo CD instance. By default, any new instance has permissions to manage resources only in the namespace where it is deployed.

[WARNING]
====
* A Kubernetes user with access to the Argo CD namespace is an Argo CD administrator and can bypass any role-based access control (RBAC) restrictions configured in Argo CD. Never grant non-administrator users any read or write access to the Argo CD namespace.
* If non-administrator users create applications, do not allow them to be bound to the default AppProject custom resource (CR) because it has no restrictions. Otherwise, the Kubernetes permissions of the Argo CD instances and the default AppProject CR allow deployment of everything everywhere. To prevent this situation, lock down the default AppProject CR so no one can use it accidentally, even when someone misconfigures the Argo CD RBAC.
