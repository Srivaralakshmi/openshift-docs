= Instance-per-tenant model

The instance-per-tenant model provides the highest isolation level between tenants. This model supports a single Argo CD instance per application delivery team (tenant), either self-provisioned or centrally provisioned by the cluster administrator. 

As an {OCP} user, if you have appropriate role-based access control (RBAC) permissions to create Argo CD resources in the cluster, you can create self-managed Argo CD instances in your user-defined namespace. These Argo CD instances allow you to manage namespace-scoped resources that are in the same installation namespace as the Argo CD instance. Self-provisioned instances often do not require any intervention by cluster administrators and allow tenants complete control over the Argo CD instance without affecting other tenants. If you require managing resources in other namespaces, you can extend permissions for such self-managed Argo CD instances accordingly. 

Suppose your tenants use secret management solutions that require a private key to be configured in Argo CD such as the Argo CD Vault plugin, git-crypt, or SOPS (Secrets OPerationS). In that case, you must provide each tenant with a unique Argo CD instance using the self-provisioning model.
