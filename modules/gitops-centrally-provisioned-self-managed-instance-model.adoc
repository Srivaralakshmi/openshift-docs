= Centrally provisioned self-managed instance model

The centrally provisioned self-managed instance model suits scenarios where most tenants lack the knowledge of managing Argo CD effectively. In this model, the cluster administrator essentially owns the Argo CD custom resource (CR). The cluster-scoped Argo CD instance manages the Argo CD CR and pushes out user-defined Argo CD instances in addition to objects such as namespaces or quotas. Tenants cannot change the RBAC permissions or add resource exclusions directly to the CR because the cluster-scoped Argo CD instance will further revert all such changes. However, to support this workflow, you can give the tenant read-only access to the Git repository that stores the Argo CD CR, and the tenant can create pull requests.
