== Fixed issues

* Before this update, the sync trigger for a webhook enabled on Bitbucket was not working, resulting in an application failing to refresh after a change. This update fixes the issue by modifying the functionality of the {gitops-title} Operator to ensure that the sync trigger on webhooks automatically refreshes an application after a change. https://issues.redhat.com/browse/GITOPS-5045[GITOPS-5045]
