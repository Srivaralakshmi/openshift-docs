= Mapping of multitenancy models

The multitenancy models are not equivalent, and a specific comparison does not provide a technically accurate mapping because the criteria for choosing a model varies depending on the use cases and tenants. The following table and the information correlate in general:

.Multitenancy models - selection criteria
[cols="1,.1,5a",options="header"]
|===
|Multitenancy model|Selection criteria

|Instance-per-tenant|Choose this model if tenants use plugins such as SOPS, Argo CD Vault, or helm-secrets that require secret data to be available at the time of manifest generation. 

|Centrally managed Argo CD instance|Choose this model if tenants need deployments across multiple namespaces that require them to deploy distinct cluster-scoped resources additionally.

[NOTE]
====
Currently, do not use this model if tenants do not trust each other.
====

|Centrally provisioned self-managed instance|Choose this model if tenants need complete control over centrally provisioned instances for each tenant.
