When you open a support case, you must provide debugging information about your cluster to the Red Hat Support team. You can use the `must-gather` tool to collect diagnostic information for project-level resources, cluster-level resources, and {gitops-title} components.Â 

[NOTE]
====
For prompt support, provide diagnostic information for both {OCP} and {gitops-title}.
