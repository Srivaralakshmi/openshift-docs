= Release notes for {servicebinding-title} 1.2

{servicebinding-title} 1.2 is now available on {product-title} 4.7, 4.8, 4.9, 4.10, and 4.11.

[id="new-features-1-2_{context}"]
== New features
This section highlights what is new in {servicebinding-title} 1.2:

* Enable {servicebinding-title} to consider optional fields in the annotations by setting the `optional` flag value to `true`.
* Support for `servicebinding.io/v1beta1` resources.

[id="fixed-issues-1-2_{context}"]
== Fixed issues
* Previously, the container user had default permission to read, write, and execute the projected files. With this update, to enhance the security, all the projected files now are read-only for the container user and not readable by others. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/APPSVC-1127[APPSVC-1127]

[id="known-issues-1-2_{context}"]
== Known issues
* There is currently a known issue with installing {servicebinding-title} in a single namespace installation mode. The absence of an appropriate namespace-scoped role-based access control (RBAC) rule prevents the successful binding of an application to a few known Operator-backed services that the {servicebinding-title} can automatically detect and bind to. When this happens, it generates an error message similar to the following example:
+
.Example error message
[source,text]
----
`postgresclusters.postgres-operator.crunchydata.com "hippo" is forbidden:
        User "system:serviceaccount:my-petclinic:service-binding-operator" cannot
        get resource "postgresclusters" in API group "postgres-operator.crunchydata.com"
        in the namespace "my-petclinic"`
----
+
Workaround 1: Install the {servicebinding-title} in the `all namespaces` installation mode. As a result, the appropriate cluster-scoped RBAC rule now exists and the binding succeeds.
+
Workaround 2: If you cannot install the {servicebinding-title} in the `all namespaces` installation mode, install the following role binding into the namespace where the {servicebinding-title} is installed:

* Currently, when you modify the `ClusterWorkloadResourceMapping` resources, the {servicebinding-title} does not implement correct behavior. As a workaround, perform the following steps:
+
--
. Delete any `ServiceBinding` resources that use the corresponding `ClusterWorkloadResourceMapping` resource.
. Modify the `ClusterWorkloadResourceMapping` resource.
. Re-apply the `ServiceBinding` resources that you previously removed in step 1.
